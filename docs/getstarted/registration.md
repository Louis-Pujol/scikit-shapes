Registration is the task of finding a suitable transformation from a source to a target shape.

A registration task must be at least parametrized with a `deformation model` and a `loss function`

- The deformation model specifies contrains about the way source can be transformed to match target.
- The loss function measure the discrepency between the morphed source and the target
